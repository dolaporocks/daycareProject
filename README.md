# DaycareProject

PROJECT DESCRIPTION

This is a project created with the use of Flutter, Dart and Firebase with inspiration from a client for connecting daycare providers to parents. 
This idea originated from the concept of closing the gap to bridge the difficulties between finding a licensed daycare provider based on your location
and help daycare providers who are looking for jobs to earn a living. 
A Parent or a Daycare Provider can Register on the application and gain access to what they need, but the view for each party boils down differently. 
For a Parent, when you create an account the idea is that you are able to set your locations and then find a licensed and verified daycare provider who is 
situated around you, you can then book an appointment with the provider and also have access to a chat platform integrated within it to communicate with 
each other which also helps in driving traffic to the application. 
For a Daycare Provider, once you create an account you enter the licenses or certifications that you have obtained and then go through a screening process
which is what determines if you are actually able to work through the app or not. If or once you pass the screening you are able to put out an availability
and wait for someone to connect with you and then kick it off from there. 

This way we are making things easier for the Daycare Provider and Parent.
